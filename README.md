# contactBook

I wanna present my adaptation of contact book created in React Native. 

Additional general libraries used:
 - react-navigation
 - expo-image-library

The app is prepared for iOS, but it's fully functional on other devices. 
Functionality and features:
 - list sorted contacts,
 - add contact feature - involves image uploading while creating contact,
 - individual contact details screen for every created contact,
 - delete contact feature,

Preview of working app can be found [here](https://snack.expo.dev/@doseeey/contact-book)
*it is highly recommended to scan QR code and launch it on iOS phone
